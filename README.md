## Aim

The primary aim of NextFlicks is to design and develop a highly efficient and user-friendly search engine for a streaming platform akin to Netflix, focusing on TV shows. The search engine enables users to navigate through a vast collection of TV shows by leveraging various search parameters such as genre, title, description, ratings, and related shows. The ultimate goal is to enhance user experience by providing accurate, relevant, and personalized search results, making content discovery seamless and intuitive.

## Task

The core task involves implementing a sophisticated information retrieval system capable of handling complex user queries with high precision and relevance. This includes:

- **Indexing TV Shows:** Based on multiple attributes including genre, title, description, and user ratings.
- **Ranking Algorithm:** Developing an algorithm that ranks TV shows by their relevance to the user's search query, incorporating both textual match and contextual similarity.
- **Personalization:** Integrating user preferences and viewing history to tailor search results, offering a personalized content discovery experience.
- **Filtering Support:** Providing support for filtering results by genre, rating, and other metadata to allow users to refine their searches effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset for NextFlicks consists of a curated collection of TV shows, mirroring the variety and depth of content found on platforms like Netflix. Each record includes detailed information about a TV show, such as:

- **Title**
- **Rating:** On a 5-point scale
- **Genres**
- **Description**
- **Related TV Shows**

This comprehensive dataset serves as the backbone of the search engine, enabling accurate indexing and retrieval based on diverse search criteria.

## Architecture

### General Architecture

NextFlicks is designed around the Vector Space Model (VSM), utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for document representation and cosine similarity for measuring relevance between user queries and TV shows. The architecture comprises the following modules:

1. **Data Collection Module:** Gathers information about TV shows, including attributes like title, rating, genre, description, and related shows.
2. **Text Preprocessing Module:** Prepares data for analysis by tokenizing descriptions and normalizing text.
3. **TF-IDF Calculation Module:** Computes the importance of each word within the descriptions relative to the dataset.
4. **Vectorisation Module:** Transforms textual descriptions into numerical vectors using TF-IDF scores.
5. **Cosine Similarity Calculation Module:** Compares query vectors with TV show vectors to determine relevance.
6. **Ranking and Retrieval Module:** Ranks TV shows based on cosine similarity scores and retrieves the top relevant shows.

These modules work sequentially to interpret and respond to user queries by identifying and ranking content that closely matches user interests.

## Retrieval Models

NextFlicks employs the Vector Space Model (VSM) with the following components:

- **TF-IDF:** Highlights the importance of words within documents, reducing the influence of common words.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between query and document vectors, indicating similarity irrespective of vector magnitude.

This combination effectively identifies and ranks relevant TV shows based on user queries.

## Tools and Technologies

### Frontend

- **React:** For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript, CSS, HTML:** Fundamental technologies for structuring and styling frontend components.

### Backend

- **Python:** Primary language for implementing the retrieval algorithm.
- **Libraries:**
  - **NLTK:** For data preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and normalization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
  - **NumPy:** Facilitates efficient numerical computations.

### Integration

- **Node.js:** Serves as middleware between the Python backend and the React frontend.
- **Flask (Alternative):** Exposes the Python VSM model directly to the React frontend through a REST API.

Both methods are evaluated to determine the most suitable approach based on simplicity and architectural complexity.

## Datasets

Two datasets are used in the demo, saved in the `data` folder:

- **test_data.json:**  
  A small dataset used for initial testing and validation of the retrieval models.
  
- **tv_shows_1000.json:**  
  A larger dataset comprising 1,000 TV shows, providing a comprehensive basis for evaluating the search engine's performance.

These datasets include detailed information about each TV show, enabling accurate indexing and retrieval based on various search criteria.

## Conclusion

NextFlicks successfully develops a sophisticated search engine tailored for TV shows on a streaming platform similar to Netflix. By leveraging the Vector Space Model with TF-IDF and cosine similarity, the search engine efficiently retrieves and ranks TV shows based on user queries. The integration of advanced frontend and backend technologies ensures a seamless and personalized user experience.

Through strategic planning and a well-structured approach, the project achieves its objectives of enhancing content discovery and providing relevant, accurate search results. Future enhancements may explore deeper integration of user preferences, real-time data updates, and further optimization of retrieval algorithms to push the boundaries of search engine performance.
